# Advanced Reactor Modeling

This set of exercises is associated with advanced topics in *Multiphase Reactor Modeling (MRM)*. It focuses on complex couplings and interactions that arise in multiphase reactor systems. Key topics include the coupling of particle and reactor models, pressure-velocity coupling, and the integration of detailed transport phenomena with reaction kinetics. 

These exercises aim to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges involved in modeling advanced reactor systems and to develop the skills required to address them using numerical techniques and computational tools. By working through these exercises, you will gain insights into the interplay between physical, chemical, and numerical aspects of reactor modeling, enabling you to tackle real-world engineering problems with confidence.
