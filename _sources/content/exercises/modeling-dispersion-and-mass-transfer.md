# Modeling Dispersion and Mass Transfer

This set of exercises is associated with Lecture 4 of the class *Multiphase Reactor Modeling (MRM)*. It explores the concepts of dispersion and mass transfer, which are essential for understanding the behavior of multiphase systems and their impact on reactor performance. The exercises aim to provide insights into the mathematical modeling and numerical solution of these phenomena, which are critical for designing and optimizing chemical reactors.
