# ODE Solving for Reactor Modeling

This set of exercises is associated with Lecture 1 of the class *Multiphase Reactor Modeling (MRM)*. It focuses on deriving and solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for simple reactor models. The exercises aim to build a strong foundation in understanding the mathematical formulation and numerical solution of ODEs in the context of reactor modeling. By completing these exercises, you will develop the skills needed to analyze and solve ODE-based reactor models effectively.
