# 2D Reactor Models

This set of exercises is associated with Lecture 5 of the class *Multiphase Reactor Modeling (MRM)*. It focuses on developing and solving two-dimensional reactor models, which are crucial for capturing spatial variations in both radial and axial directions. These models provide deeper insights into the performance and behavior of reactors under various operating conditions.
