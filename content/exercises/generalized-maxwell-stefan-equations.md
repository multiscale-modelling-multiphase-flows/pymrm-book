# Generalized Maxwell-Stefan Equations

This set of exercises focuses on the Generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations, which describe multicomponent mass transfer in mixtures. These equations are fundamental for understanding diffusion processes in gases, liquids, and porous media, and are widely used in modeling transport phenomena in chemical engineering applications.
