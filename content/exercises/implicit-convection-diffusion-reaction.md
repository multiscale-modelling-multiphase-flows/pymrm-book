# Implicit Convection-Diffusion-Reaction

This set of exercises is associated with Lecture 3 of the class *Multiphase Reactor Modeling (MRM)*. It emphasizes the numerical solution of implicit convection-diffusion-reaction equations, which are critical for accurately modeling complex reactor systems.
