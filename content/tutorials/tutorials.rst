Tutorials
=========

Below is a list of Python notebooks that provide tutorials for learning to make reactor models using the ``pymrm``.
The notebooks can also be directly downloaded from the GitHub repository:
`pymrm/tutorials <https://github.com/multiscale-modelling-multiphase-flows/pymrm/tree/main/tutorials>`_.

This is work in progress, and we will be adding more tutorials in the future.
